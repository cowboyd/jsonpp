This project grew out of two needs I had that were not satisfied by the json libs out there.

1) The ability to render JSON from arbitrary object graphs without having to modify or annotate any source code, add
annotations, etc.

2) Be a little bit lax on outputting strictly compliant JSON


I wanted this because I was doing some demo code for the Detroit Java User group which required the audience to view
the json output, and I was more interested in parseable javascript that was meant for primarily human consumption, but
could be understood by javascript parsers too.

The amount of code you need to encode arbitrary objects is about as minimal as it gets for java since it uses
pattern matching (a concept from functional programming) to select which encoder to use for a given object.


It wouldn't take all that much work to have it output xml, ruby or whatever.
